<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I've started my path on technology in 2020, when, wanting to create a website for having access to the whole body of brazilian laws, I've stumbled into a problem: there is not any existing tech solution for that. And there is no way to build it easily. In order to do it I had to learn a whole profession.
<p>That's what I did. I looked up whitch programming language existed and decided to learn JavaScript with online courses.</p>
<p>In 2022, in order to understand better the whole field of knowledge, I've started the Bachelor of Science in Information Systems, whitch I finnished in 2025.</p>
</p>
<p>Before that, I've started my professional life as a lawyer, having entered law school in 2011 and garduating in 2016.</p>
<p>Currently I still work in the field, as a judicial clerk for the Brazilian District Court in the state of Paran√°, looking forward to make a carreer shift to the tech industry.</p>
